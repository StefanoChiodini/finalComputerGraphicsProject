# :game_die: Computer Graphics - Project 
This is the repository for the projects of Computer Graphics course held at [Polimi](https://www.polimi.it/).

The course held on 3 main topics:
* Basic 3D graphics
* [Vulkan API](https://www.vulkan.org/)
* Shaders and real-time rendering

The coverage of this topics was done through the development of 20 assignment and a final project to put in practice all the knowledge acquired. 

:hammer_and_wrench: All the projects were developed in C++ with a [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) solution. To set up the environment,  [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/) and [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) are needed. Tutorial on how to set up the environment can be found [here](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Development_environment).
